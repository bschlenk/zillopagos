# zillopagos

An experimental Zillow property finder helper tool.

## Installation

Tentative. For now, fork this repo and start hacking. [Sign
up](https://www.zillow.com/howto/api/APIOverview.htm) for Zillow and
create a file called `.env` with the contents

```
ZWSID=<your-zwsid>
```

replacing `<your-zwsid>` with the id that Zillow has given you.

## What is this?

I was very impressed with
[aparemnt-finder](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/apartment-finder), a
slack bot for fiding apartments by scraping craigslist.

Why not take this one step further and use the Zillow api to automate
finding the perfect house?
